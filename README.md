To download the latest version, 
Look in this main folder for a .jar file. 
The highest number .jar file is the most current.

If you're looking for a specific version, here's what the numbers mean:
YYMMDD
First two chars are the year  (2015      -> 15)
Next  two chars are the month (februrary -> 02)
Last  two chars are the day   (16th      -> 16)

Download the .jar if you're looking to use. 
If you want to help code, then submit a pull request and look through the Code folder.


Code is based on PIRCBot framework
